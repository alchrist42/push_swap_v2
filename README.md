### push_swap_v2
Second version school42 project about shortest sorting for the stack.  
Main idea from  [VBrazhnik](https://github.com/VBrazhnik/Push_swap/wiki/Algorithm). partII.

* No special cases for 3 or 5 elements.
* sorting 100 elements - ~550 moves, worst 650.
* sorting 500 elements - ~4000 moves, worst 4500.
* sorintg >2000 elements using merge_sort, extremely faster than the main algoritm.


#### Short task description

*We get the "stack a" from integers via arguments. Need to sort it, using only an additional "stack b" and a few special commands, some of which are: push_b, rotate, reverse_rotate, swap_first_two.*
